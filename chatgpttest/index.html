      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to our website about convolutional neural networks (CNNs)! CNNs are a type of artificial neural network used for image and video analysis, among other applications. In this website, you will find information about how CNNs work, some examples of their applications, and resources for learning more about them.</p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>CNNs are designed to process data with a grid-like topology, such as images. They consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, called neurons, which process and transmit information. The layers of a CNN are arranged in such a way as to extract features from the input data, with each layer analyzing a different aspect of the data. The output of the CNN is then used to make a prediction or classification based on the extracted features.</p>
